# UROP

## These are some files that I've been working with during my UROP

I've been trying to train a regression model based on Gaussian Processes using the GPflow Library. 
I'm mostly practicing with TensorFlow although I've tried to implement a neural network using a Keras framework.
Most of my work at this point is centered around trying to create a modified version of the RBF kernel in GPflow 
that is able to have a variable number of lengthscales in order to mimic the functions of ARD.
